  <p>
    Wasn't that a cool entrance? That's exactly what I love doing — building fun, immersive web experiences that feel alive and intuitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hey! I'm Malak, a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I love building software and hardware projects that merge functionality with creativity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it’s designing gesture-controlled AI tools, building 3D portfolio sites, or optimizing full-stack systems — I love using code to solve problems in fun and impactful ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve worked on everything from React and Node.js to embedded systems and creative animations using GSAP and Framer Motion. I’m all about exploring, experimenting, and expressing ideas through tech.
  </p>

  <!-- 💖 Sisters -->
  <p>
    Outside of engineering, I'm also a  big sister! I have two younger sisters who will never stop annoying me. Here's a photo of us together when we were younger.

  <!-- 🌍 Travel -->
  <p>
    I also love to travel — it inspires me to think creatively and live curiously. Here's a glimpse into a trip that really changed my perspective!
