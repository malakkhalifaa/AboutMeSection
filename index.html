          I'm Malak Khalifa, a web developer with a passion for creating
          interactive web experiences!

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            I'm Malak — a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto who fell down the rabbit hole of web development and decided to stay there. What started as “hmm, how does this website even work?” quickly turned into building immersive 3D portfolios, gesture-controlled AI apps, and full-stack platforms from scratch. I write code that not only works — it dances.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Over the past year, I’ve interned as a Software Engineer across three countries (yes, remotely counts) where I picked up serious skills in React, Angular, Node.js, and Express. I’ve clocked 100+ hours in agile environments, survived CI/CD pipelines, and even made scroll-triggered SVG animations look cool. As Webmaster Director of UofT’s largest engineering competition, I redesigned the site for 1,500+ users, built 20+ features, and dropped bounce rates like hot bugs.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I also love projects that blend tech with creativity — from an AI-powered drawing tool that reads hand gestures (and actually works), to a balcony storage prototype that passed moisture resistance tests like a champ (who knew rubber gaskets would be the MVP?). I'm fluent in HTML, CSS, JS, Python, C++, and sarcasm.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I’m always building, breaking, and rebuilding cooler things — and I’d love to build something awesome with you too. Thanks for stopping by — scroll around and say hi!
